       <p> Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, emerged from humble
    beginnings to become one of the most recognized figures in sports history. <br>Raised in a segregated America, Ali faced the
    harsh realities of racial discrimination and systemic injustice from an early age. His parents, Cassius Clay Sr. <br>and
    Odessa Clay, instilled in him a strong sense of self-worth and pride in his African American heritage.<br> As a child, Ali
    was often exposed to the complexities of race relations in the South, which shaped his understanding of social justice.<br>
    At the age of 12, after his bicycle was stolen, he took up boxing to learn self-defense, motivated not only by a desire
    to protect himself but also by a need to prove his strength and resilience.<br> He began training at the local Columbia Gym
    under the guidance of trainer Joe Martin, quickly showing promise as a fighter. <br>Ali's early dedication to the sport,
    coupled with his natural talent and flair for performance, laid the groundwork for<br> what would become an illustrious
    amateur career and, ultimately, a transformative impact on the world of sports and beyond.</p>
