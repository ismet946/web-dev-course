                The Durrani Empire is considered to be the foundational polity of the modern nation state of
                Afghanistan, with Ahmad
                Shah Durrani being credited as its Father of the Nation.[7] However, Dost Mohammad Khan is sometimes
                considered to be
                the founder of the first modern Afghan state.[8] Following the Durrani Empire's decline and the death of
                Ahmad Shah
                Durrani and Timur Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not
                limited to Herat,
                Kandahar and Kabul. Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after seven decades of civil war
                from 1793 to
                1863, with wars of unification led by Dost Mohammad Khan from 1823 to 1863, where he conquered the
                independent
                principalities of Afghanistan under the Emirate of Kabul. Dost Mohammad died in 1863, days after his
                last campaign to
                unite Afghanistan, and Afghanistan was consequently thrown back into civil war with fighting amongst his
                successors.
                During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Raj in South
                Asia and the
                Russian Empire. The British Raj attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but was repelled in the First
                Anglo-Afghan War.
                However, the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British
                political
                influence over Afghanistan. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of
                foreign political
                hegemony, and emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan. This
                monarchy lasted
                almost half a century, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of
                Afghanistan was
                established.
